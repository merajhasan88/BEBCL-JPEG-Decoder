# Acorn CLE-215+ (Xilinx Artix-7 XC7A200T): decoders measured over a UART

A board build that runs one JPEG decoder at a time on real hardware and reports its clock count,
a checksum of its pixels and its error bits for each file sent over a UART. It was written for
the remote boards of [fpgas.online](https://fpgas.online) (Welland site: SQRL Acorn CLE-215+ with
an Artix-7 XC7A200T, wired to a Raspberry Pi 5 that loads the FPGA over GPIO JTAG and talks to it
over its UART), and it measures this library's decoder and, for comparison, two other open-source
FPGA JPEG decoders under identical conditions.

## Files

|---|---|
| `uart_bench_core.sv` | vendor-neutral: UART receiver and transmitter, 4 KB input FIFO, protocol, the decoder under test, counters |

## How the measurement works

The decoder's clock is the core clock gated by a glitch-free clock buffer (`BUFGCE`). The gate is
open only while the decoder's next input is waiting in the FIFO, during its reset, and after the
whole file has arrived until the frame is done. So at every decoder clock the input is available,
and `clocks` is the decode time with an ideal input, independent of the UART speed; it equals
the cycle-exact simulation (`tb/` for this library, `bench/others/tb_other.cpp` for the others).
The checksum is the sum over all pixels of `{(x ^ y)[7:0], R, G, B}` mod 2^32, as on the EP2C5
boards, so it does not depend on the pixel order. A decoder that stalls is ended after 2^26 of its
clocks without a pixel (flag `watchdog`), so the next file still runs.

Protocol (8N1): host to FPGA `55 AA 'J' 'P' len[31:0]` (big-endian) and the file; FPGA to host,
32 bytes when the frame is done: `'R' 'E' 'S' DUT, flags, 0 0 0, clocks[31:0], checksum[31:0],
err[15:0], width[15:0], height[15:0], pixels[31:0], bytes[31:0], 0 0` (flags: 1 FIFO overflow,
2 watchdog, 4 done).

## Build and run

```sh
# Vivado (tested with 2026.1; it needs a licence file, the free "Vivado Basic" licence covers the
# 7-series; on Ubuntu 22.04 it also needs libtinfo.so.5 from the libtinfo5 package)
vivado -mode batch -source build.tcl -tclargs <DUT> <CLKOUT_DIV> <out_dir>
#   DUT 3 at 150 MHz needs VIVADO_EFFORT=high (stronger placement / routing): +0.013 ns; the default flow
#   gives -0.10 ns (the one-symbol-per-clock Huffman loop is routing-bound)
#   CLKOUT_DIV 8 = 150 MHz (this library, aq_djpeg), 13 = 92.3 MHz (core_jpeg); VIVADO_THREADS limits threads
# load the bitstream into the FPGA's configuration RAM (not its flash), e.g. on the Pi:
openFPGALoader --cable libgpiod --pins 10:9:11:8 acorn_dut0_div8.bit
python3 pi_bench.py /dev/ttyAMA0 1000000 photo1.jpg photo2.jpg
# expected results (libjpeg 9e djpeg built by ../../bench/run_bench.py; tb/obj_fmcu built by `make`)
python3 make_expected.py --djpeg <libjpeg 9e djpeg> --out expected.json photo1.jpg photo2.jpg
# the harness in simulation (8 clocks per UART bit)
cd sim && verilator --top-module uart_sim_top -GDUT=0 -cc <rtl files> ../uart_bench_core.sv uart_sim_top.sv --exe tb_uart.cpp ...
```

Timing is checked against the -2 speed grade (`xc7a200tfbg484-2`); the board's chip is a -3.
To port the harness to another board, keep `uart_bench_core.sv` and replace the top: a clock
source, a glitch-free gated clock buffer for the decoder (Intel `ALTCLKCTRL` with its enable,
Lattice `DCC`, ...) and the pins. Without a gated clock the count would include the time spent
waiting for the UART.

What the runs show:

- **The wide core (`FAST=2`, DUT 3, run on 2026-10-04) decoded all 24 files with pixels identical to
  libjpeg 9e** at 0.295-0.561 clocks/pixel on the 4:2:2 originals and 0.255-0.417 on the 4:2:0 copies,
  3.0-4.0x fewer clocks than the fast core: 22.0-48.6 ms per 12-megapixel photo at 150 MHz. Every
  clock count equals the cycle-exact simulation. That is 0.64-0.80x the time of libjpeg-turbo
  -nosmooth on one laptop core at 3.9 GHz and 0.64-0.88x that of the fastest CPU decoder on each file
  (`../../BENCHMARKS.md`). With the harness it needs 6,211 LUTs, 33 DSPs and 9 block-RAM tiles (the
  decoder alone 5,827 LUTs, 6,831 flip-flops); 150 MHz is met with `VIVADO_EFFORT=high` (+0.013 ns).
  The 24 files ran on the build before two fixes found by Vivado's xsim (a missing reset of the IDCT
  pipeline's valid bits; a workaround for an xsim bug); the final bitstream was run on 3 of them
  (adapter.jpg, IMG20260716020409.jpg, adapter_420.jpg): 3/3 PASS with identical clocks and checksums.
  The site had renamed the board page to `pi-sw2-p46` by then (the same Acorn).
- **This library decoded all 24 files with pixels identical to libjpeg 9e**, at 1.18-1.78
  clocks/pixel on the 4:2:2 originals and 1.005-1.37 on the 4:2:0 copies, 87-154 ms per
  12-megapixel photo at 150 MHz. Each clock count equals the cycle-exact simulation and the counts
  measured on the Cyclone II EP2C5 board (`adapter.jpg`: 19,234,181 clocks on both).
- **aq_djpeg decoded all 24**, with 1.37-1.95x as many clocks per file as this library, at a similar
  Fmax (153 MHz). Its pixels differ from libjpeg's by up to 4-12 levels (PSNR 41.6-46.8 dB).
- **core_jpeg decoded none of the originals**: it does not support 4:2:2, and on these files it
  reads the header of the EXIF thumbnail (128x176) and then stalls. It decoded all 12 4:2:0 copies
  at a nearly constant 2.14-2.19 clocks/pixel, with the lowest Fmax (95-104 MHz on this part):
  about 301 ms per photo at 92.3 MHz. Its pixels differ by up to 4-12 levels (PSNR 42.0-46.7 dB).
- **Every board result of the other two decoders equals their own simulation** (clock count and
  checksum), so the harness measures each decoder exactly as simulated.
- This library is also the smallest of the three in logic (2,488 LUTs against 4,919 and 6,681,
  harness included); aq_djpeg uses the fewest block RAMs (4 tiles against 7.5) and DSPs (14 against 17).

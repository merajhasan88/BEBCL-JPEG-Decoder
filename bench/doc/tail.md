## What the numbers say

### Against CPU decoders

1. **At full clock, one laptop core beats the EP2C5 on every image.** All CPU times in these
   comparisons are taken at a steady 3.9 GHz, the laptop's highest measured clock: the runs were
   measured at 3.4-3.9 GHz (the laptop throttles), so each is rescaled from its cycle count (the
   CPU's best case). libjpeg-turbo -nosmooth (the same pixels as this decoder) decodes donald.jpg in
   6.8 ms against the EP2C5's 30.0 ms (4.4x faster), the 12-megapixel phone photos in 53-68 ms
   against 203-284 ms (3.8-4.1x) and the 4:4:4 portrait in 16.7 ms against 88.3 ms (5.3x). Even the
   slowest CPU decoder on each large photo is 1.4-1.9x faster than the EP2C5 (libjpeg 9e with its
   default upsampling, or stb_image, depending on the image). Apart from the pure-Python reference model, the only CPU
   result the FPGA beats is Pillow on the 64x64 image, where Python's per-call overhead dominates.
2. **Per clock, the FPGA does about 10x more work.** It needs 1.0-2.25 clocks per pixel. libjpeg-turbo
   with SIMD (AVX2) needs 8-22 CPU clocks per pixel, and libjpeg 9e and stb_image need 20-52 on the
   large photos. But
   the laptop's clock is 40x higher (3.9 GHz against 95 MHz). At the laptop's power-saver clock
   (~1 GHz) libjpeg-turbo and the EP2C5 are close. The CPU is 7-47 % faster on six images and level
   (3 %) on the 320x240 image. It takes 21 % longer on the 64x64 image (see the last table of the
   results).
3. **Energy per image is the FPGA's clear advantage.** donald.jpg costs ~4.4 mJ on the EP2C5
   (PowerPlay estimate 147 mW x 30 ms). libjpeg-turbo uses 124 mJ of CPU package energy at full
   clock and 65 mJ in the power-saver profile, so the FPGA uses 15-28x less. Both figures are
   rough: the FPGA's is a vectorless estimate that includes I/O, and the CPU's is RAPL package
   energy that includes background power.
4. **Correction.** Earlier versions of this file, README.md and the project notes said the EP2C5
   at 95 MHz decodes donald.jpg faster than libjpeg-turbo, FFmpeg and Pillow on one laptop core
   (30.0 ms against 32.8-42.6 ms). Those CPU numbers were measured with the laptop in its
   power-saver profile (~0.8-1 GHz), and so was the first run on 2026-09-30. FFmpeg was also
   measured without its RGB conversion. **That claim is withdrawn.** At full clock the laptop is
   3-6x faster. What still holds is the per-clock and energy comparison above.
5. **The decode time is the decoder alone.** On this board the file arrives over JTAG at ~35 KB/s
   (170 s for a 5.9 MB photo), and the pixels are checked on the chip. To keep up with the
   decoder, a system needs an input path of ~8 MB/s (donald.jpg) to ~21 MB/s (the dense phone
   photo). It also needs a consumer that takes 42-93 Mpixel/s in 8x8 / 16x16 tiles.
6. **The compact core** (`FAST=0`, 3.4k LEs, 50 MHz) needs 12.8-21 clocks/pixel (0.75 s for
   donald.jpg). Use it when area matters more than speed. It is also the core that fits the EP2C5
   with raster output and Pillow-exact smoothing (up to 352 pixels wide for 4:2:0).
7. **Among the CPU decoders** at 3.9 GHz (on the 320x240 image and the large photos),
   libjpeg-turbo is the fastest. Pillow (which uses it inside) takes 1.14-1.47x as long. OpenCV
   takes 1.45-2.29x and FFmpeg (its own decoder, plus the RGB conversion) 1.18-2.91x. libjpeg 9e
   takes 1.89-2.16x (`-nosmooth`) and stb_image 2.04-2.67x; neither has SIMD. (On some of the
   owner's photos below FFmpeg is faster than libjpeg-turbo.)

8. **On the owner's photos (2026-10-04, the section above), none of the FPGA decoders measured on
   2026-10-03 beats the fast CPU decoders on single-image time.** At a steady 3.9 GHz (the runs
   measured 2.3-3.9 GHz) one laptop core decodes a 12-megapixel photo in 28-62 ms with libjpeg-turbo
   -nosmooth, 25-80 ms with FFmpeg, 48-112 ms with zune-jpeg (Rust) and 54-95 ms with Pillow.
   BEBCL-JPEG (`FAST=1`) takes 87-154 ms on the Artix-7 at 150 MHz (2.2-3.2x libjpeg-turbo
   -nosmooth's time) and 137-243 ms on the EP2C5 at 95 MHz; aq_djpeg 119-295 ms, core_jpeg 301-308 ms
   (4:2:0 only). BEBCL-JPEG on the Artix-7 is faster than Go's `image/jpeg` (156-305 ms) on every
   photo, than stb_image on 20 of 24 and than libjpeg 9e with its default upsampling on 16 of 24.
   Per clock it does 8.2-11.7x more work than libjpeg-turbo (1.0-1.8 clocks per pixel against
   8.3-18.5 CPU clocks per pixel). What limits it is the clock (150 MHz against 3.9 GHz) and its one
   pixel per clock, not memory.
9. **The wide core (`FAST=2`, 2026-10-04) is faster than every CPU decoder on every photo.** On the
   same Artix-7 board at 150 MHz it decodes the 24 files in 22.0-48.6 ms (0.255-0.561 clocks per
   pixel, 3.0-4.0x fewer clocks than the fast core), with pixels identical to libjpeg 9e and clock
   counts identical to the simulation. That is 0.64-0.80x the time of libjpeg-turbo -nosmooth on one
   laptop core at a steady 3.9 GHz (1.24-1.57x faster) and 0.64-0.88x the time of the fastest CPU
   decoder on each photo (libjpeg-turbo, or FFmpeg on three files). It decodes one Huffman symbol
   per clock and four pixels per clock in 6,211 LUTs and 33 DSPs of the XC7A200T (with the harness);
   at 131 MHz or more it would still beat every CPU decoder on every photo. Single-image time on one
   CPU core is the comparison here: several CPU cores decoding several photos at once would still
   outrun one decoder in throughput; several decoders side by side on one FPGA would answer that
   (not built yet).
10. **Correction (2026-10-04).** Until then this file and README.md compared the FPGA with CPU
   times as measured while the laptop throttled (2.3-3.9 GHz), and with libjpeg-turbo's default
   (smoothing) mode: "libjpeg-turbo 1.9-2.7x faster than BEBCL-JPEG on the Artix-7", "faster than
   stb_image on every photo". With every CPU time at a steady 3.9 GHz and libjpeg-turbo -nosmooth,
   which gives the same pixels as this decoder, these are 2.2-3.2x and 20 of 24 (the owner spotted
   the throttled comparison). Per-clock figures were always computed from cycle counts and stand.

### Against other FPGA decoders

- **Neither core_jpeg nor aq_djpeg fits the EP2C5.** On the EP2C35 they need 7.0k-9.5k logic
  elements and 34-64 9-bit multiplier elements; the EP2C5 has 4,608 and 26. This decoder is the
  only one of the three that runs on the owner's board.
- **On the larger Cyclone II this decoder leads on every measure but one.** It has the highest Fmax
  (103.8 MHz against 60.2 and 40.1-40.4 MHz) and the fewest clocks per pixel on every image. It
  uses the fewest logic elements (4.4k against 7.0k-9.5k) and multipliers (26 against 34-64). It
  uses the most block-RAM bits (55.6 kbit against 27.5-51.2 kbit). It is the only one whose pixels
  are identical to libjpeg's; the others differ by up to 14 (core_jpeg) and 32 (aq_djpeg) levels,
  PSNR 42-51 dB. donald.jpg takes 30.0 ms on the EP2C5 board at 95 MHz, against 66.4 ms for
  aq_djpeg (60 MHz) and 148 ms for core_jpeg (40 MHz).
- **core_jpeg fails on the owner's phone photos.** It decodes the 512x384 EXIF thumbnail inside the
  APP1 segment instead of the photo. It also mis-decodes the 4:4:4 portrait and the q6 strip, and
  it does not support 4:2:2 or restart markers.
- **aq_djpeg decodes every file**, at 1.4-5.0 clocks/pixel. That makes it 3.0-3.3x slower than this
  decoder on the phone photos.
- **On the same Artix-7 board** (XC7A200T, the table above) this decoder runs at 150 MHz (Fmax
  160 MHz), aq_djpeg at 150 MHz (153 MHz) and core_jpeg at 92.3 MHz (95-104 MHz). On every one of
  the 24 files this decoder needs the fewest clocks: aq_djpeg needs 1.37-1.95x as many, and
  core_jpeg 1.6-2.1x on the 4:2:0 copies, which at its lower clock makes it 2.6-3.5x slower per
  photo. core_jpeg decoded none of the 4:2:2 originals (it reads the EXIF thumbnail's header and
  stalls). This decoder is also the smallest in logic (2,488 LUTs against 4,919 and 6,681, harness
  included); aq_djpeg uses fewer block RAMs (4 tiles against 7.5) and DSP blocks (14 against 17).
- Commercial cores were not available for testing. CAST's JPEG-DX-F data sheet quotes 2-32
  samples per clock (e.g. 300 Msamples/s) with 6,700 ALMs on Cyclone V or 18,250 LUT4 on ECP5 at
  70 MHz. These are vendor figures for larger devices, not measured on the same files.

## Where more speed would come from

- **On the EP2C5 this design is close to the ceiling.** The fast core uses 4,473 of 4,608 LEs and
  all 26 multiplier elements, and each of its three limits would need more logic or multipliers
  than the device has:
  - the output, at 1 pixel per clock (4:2:0 photos such as donald.jpg);
  - the IDCT, with 13 multipliers and 32 clocks per block, which is 1.5 clocks per pixel for 4:4:4;
  - the Huffman decoder, at 3 clocks per coded coefficient (the dense phone photos).
- **Matching one laptop core at full clock** (~400 Mpixel/s on donald.jpg) needs ~4 pixels per clock
  at 100 MHz. There are two ways to get there on a larger FPGA:
  - a wider decoder: 2 coefficients per clock in the Huffman decoder, more IDCT lanes, and 2-4
    pixels per clock out;
  - several decoders working on different images (an MJPEG stream, a batch).

  A single image without restart markers cannot simply be split between decoders, because its
  Huffman-coded data has to be decoded in order. None of the owner's photos has restart markers.
- **Newer FPGA families** would run the same RTL at a higher clock (not measured here).

`bench_powersaver.json` holds the CPU runs in the laptop's power-saver profile. Its libjpeg-turbo
`-nosmooth` rows were re-run with the clock recorded (`BENCH_ONLY="libjpeg-turbo (nosmooth)"
python3 run_bench.py bench_powersaver.json`). Caveats: CPU decoders ran single-threaded on one
pinned core, and RAPL energy includes background package power.

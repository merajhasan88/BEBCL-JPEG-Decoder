# BEBCL-JPEG Decoder

**B**it-**E**xact, **B**ackwards-**C**ompatible, **L**east clocks-per-pixel **JPEG** decoder: a streaming
baseline JPEG decoder for FPGAs, in SystemVerilog. JPEG bytes in, pixels out, with no processor and
no frame buffer. It decodes baseline JPEG (ITU-T T.81 sequential DCT, Huffman coding, 8-bit
samples), which is what cameras, phones and almost all software write.

- **Bit-exact**: its pixels are identical to libjpeg 9e, or (one build option) to Pillow, OpenCV
  and libjpeg-turbo, on every test file and photo.
- **Backwards-compatible**: plain SystemVerilog in the subset that Quartus II 13.0sp1 accepts, with
  no vendor primitives (RAMs and multipliers are inferred). The same RTL runs on a 2004 Intel/Altera
  Cyclone II (EP2C5, 4,608 logic elements) and a current Xilinx Artix-7, and builds with Quartus,
  Vivado and Yosys (Lattice ECP5).
- **Least clocks per pixel** among the open-source FPGA JPEG decoders measured (below): 1.0-2.4
  clocks per pixel for the fast core, 0.25-0.56 on phone photos for the wide core (`FAST=2`, four
  pixels per clock), which on an Artix-7 at 150 MHz decodes a 12-megapixel photo faster than any CPU
  decoder on one laptop core.

Every build option is verified **bit for bit** against a reference decoder:

| profile (build options) | pixels identical to |
|---|---|
| default | libjpeg 9e `djpeg -dct int -nosmooth` |
| `RASTER_OUT=1 FANCY_UPSAMPLE=1 CC_TURBO=1` | **Pillow, OpenCV** and libjpeg-turbo `djpeg -dct int` (libjpeg-turbo 2.1 defaults) |

Three cores share one interface: a compact core (`FAST=0`, ~13.6 clocks per pixel, the smallest),
a pipelined core (`FAST=1`, **1.0-2.4 clocks per pixel**) and, for larger FPGAs, a wide core
(`FAST=2`, **0.25-0.56 clocks per pixel** on phone photos, four pixels per output beat, MCU order).

| measured on a board | core | clock | resources | 12-megapixel photo |
|---|---|---:|---|---:|
| Intel/Altera Cyclone II EP2C5T144C8 (2004, 4,608 LEs) | `FAST=1` | 95 MHz | 4,425 LEs (96 %), 26/26 multipliers | 202-284 ms |
| Xilinx Artix-7 XC7A200T (Acorn CLE-215+, remote board at fpgas.online) | `FAST=1` | 150 MHz | 2,488 LUTs, 17 DSP48E1, 7.5 BRAM | 87-154 ms |
| the same Artix-7 board | `FAST=2` | 150 MHz | 6,211 LUTs, 33 DSP48E1, 9 BRAM | **22-49 ms** |

How it compares with the two other open-source FPGA JPEG decoders and with CPU decoders: below and
in **[BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md)** (Artix-7 details: `boards/acorn_cle215/README.md`).

## What sets it apart

Compared with the two other open-source FPGA JPEG decoders that could be measured, ultraembedded
core_jpeg and H. Ishihara's aq_djpeg (same harness, same board, same files):

- **Bit-exact.** BEBCL-JPEG's pixels are identical to libjpeg 9e, or with `RASTER_OUT=1
  FANCY_UPSAMPLE=1 CC_TURBO=1` to Pillow, OpenCV and libjpeg-turbo. Those of core_jpeg and
  aq_djpeg differ from libjpeg's by up to 4-14 levels on the photos (PSNR 41.6-46.8 dB) and by up
  to 32 on one small test file.
- **Fewest clocks per pixel.** 0.25-0.56 for the wide core on the photos and 1.0-2.4 for the fast
  core, against 1.4-5.0 (aq_djpeg) and 2.1-3.3
  (core_jpeg, on the files it can decode). On the same Artix-7 board the others needed 1.4-2.1x
  more clocks per photo, and BEBCL-JPEG has the highest Fmax of the three (160 MHz against 153
  and 95-104 MHz), so it decoded every photo fastest: 87-154 ms at 150 MHz, against 119-295 ms
  (aq_djpeg, 150 MHz) and about 301 ms (core_jpeg, 92.3 MHz, 4:2:0 copies only).
- **Small enough for a 2004 FPGA.** The fast decoder fits the 4,608-LE Cyclone II EP2C5 with its 26
  multipliers and runs at 95 MHz; on the larger EP2C35 the others need 7.8k-9.5k LEs and 34-64
  multiplier elements. On the Artix-7 it is 2,204 LUTs alone and 2,488 with the measurement
  harness, against 4,919 (aq_djpeg) and 6,681 (core_jpeg) with the same harness.
- **Handles real camera files.** Every baseline chroma layout (4:4:4, 4:2:2, 4:2:0, 4:4:0, mixed),
  restart markers, EXIF thumbnails skipped correctly. core_jpeg supports neither 4:2:2 nor restart
  markers, and on phone photos with an EXIF thumbnail it read the thumbnail instead of the photo.
- **Defined behaviour on bad input.** Headers and tables are validated; every image ends with
  exactly one "frame done" and an error code, also when the file is truncated or corrupt (26
  malformed files, tested in simulation and on the board).
- **Output for real pipelines.** MCU order, or strict raster order with start-of-frame /
  end-of-line flags for an AXI4-Stream video path; RGB, YCbCr or luma-only output (luma-only skips
  the chroma blocks and is ~30 % faster); the colour converter can be removed.
- **Three cores, one interface.** A compact core (3.4k LEs, ~13.6 clocks/pixel), a fast core
  (~1-2.4 clocks/pixel, fits the EP2C5) and a wide core (~6k LUTs, 0.25-0.56 clocks/pixel), chosen
  with one parameter.
- **Verified in depth.** Two independent testbenches (C++ and SystemVerilog) run the same 2,376
  checks (bit-exact pixels, files back to back, malformed files); gate-level simulation of the
  placed design; Verilator and Vivado's simulator; hardware from two vendors.

Where the others are ahead: aq_djpeg uses fewer block RAMs (4 against 7.5 tiles) and DSP blocks
(14 against 17), and its README says it can extract the first layer of a progressive JPEG (not
tested here), which BEBCL-JPEG rejects; core_jpeg has a smaller build with fixed Huffman tables.
"Least clocks per pixel" holds among open-source decoders: commercial cores claim more, e.g. CAST's
JPEG-DX-F decodes 2 to 32 colour samples per clock depending on its configuration, where
BEBCL-JPEG's fast core decodes 1.1-1.7 on the photos and its wide core 3.6-6.8 (a 4:2:2 pixel is 2
samples, a 4:2:0 pixel 1.5).

**Against CPU decoders** (one laptop core, CPU times rescaled to a steady 3.9 GHz, the laptop's best
case; [BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md)): libjpeg-turbo -nosmooth (the same pixels) decodes a single
photo 2.2-3.2x faster than the `FAST=1` core at 150 MHz, but the `FAST=2` core at 150 MHz takes
0.64-0.80x libjpeg-turbo's time and 0.64-0.88x that of the fastest CPU decoder on each photo, measured
on the board. This is single-image time on one CPU core; a multi-core CPU decoding several photos at
once still has more throughput than one decoder.

## Quick start: decode your own images

Put your JPEGs in `test_images/` (`adapter.jpg` is already there) and pick one of three ways to
run the decoder. All three simulate the same RTL cycle by cycle, write the decoded images to
`out/` and print the decode time in clocks:

| way | needs | decode `test_images/` | compare with a reference decoder |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SystemVerilog testbench + shell** (`tb/tb_jpeg.sv`) | Verilator 5.002+ or Vivado's xsim (both tested); Questa and Icarus 12 untested (Icarus 11 is too old) | `./decode.sh` | `./decode.sh --profile pillow --check` (needs `djpeg`) |
| **C++ harness** (`tb/tb_jpeg.cpp`, Verilator) | Verilator 5, make, a C++ compiler | `make -C tb decode` | `tb/obj_fmcu/Vjpeg_decoder in.jpg out.ppm --golden ref.ppm` |
| **Python** (`scripts/decode.py`, drives the C++ harness) | the above + Python 3 (Pillow optional) | `python3 scripts/decode.py` | `python3 scripts/decode.py --profile pillow --check` |

```sh
git clone https://github.com/merajhasan88/BEBCL-JPEG-Decoder.git && cd BEBCL-JPEG-Decoder
cp ~/photos/*.jpg test_images/
./decode.sh                                   # or: ./decode.sh --sim xsim   (Vivado's simulator)
```
```
file                                    size     type       clocks  clk/px  ms@100MHz  result
adapter.jpg                        3120x4160    4:2:2     19234181   1.482     192.34  ok
```

Options of `decode.sh` and `decode.py`: `--profile libjpeg|pillow` (which reference the pixels
match: libjpeg 9e with replicated chroma, any image size; or Pillow / OpenCV / libjpeg-turbo with
smoothed chroma, raster order), `--core fast|small|wide` (`wide` = `FAST=2`, MCU order: `--profile
libjpeg` only), `--fmt rgb|ycbcr|y`, `--mhz F` (report times
at your clock), `--out DIR`. A file the decoder does not support (progressive, 12-bit, arithmetic
coding ...) is reported with its error bits.

## Using BEBCL-JPEG in your FPGA design

Add the files of `rtl/` to your project (Quartus, Vivado, Yosys, ...; `rtl/files.f` lists them in
compile order), instantiate `jpeg_decoder` and set the parameters below. `boards/` has complete examples:
`boards/ep2c5/` (Quartus II 13.0sp1, Cyclone II: ROM demo with UART output, a 95 MHz build that
streams JPEGs over the USB-Blaster) and `boards/acorn_cle215/` (Vivado, Artix-7: files over a
UART, with the decoder's clock counted on the chip).

(the compact core; the `FAST=1` core has the same structure with a 32-bit bit window, lookahead
Huffman tables, a 2-lane pipelined IDCT and 1-pixel-per-clock output stages; the `FAST=2` core
decodes one Huffman symbol per clock, transforms a block in 8 clocks with two pipelined 1-D IDCTs
and emits four pixels per clock, in MCU order.)

### Interface (`rtl/jpeg_decoder.sv`)

| port | dir | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `clk`, `rst` | in | one clock; synchronous active-high reset |
| `in_valid`, `in_data[7:0]`, `in_ready` | in | the JPEG file, one byte per accepted clock (files may follow back to back) |
| `in_last` | in | 1 on the last byte of a file (0 if unknown): a file cut short before its EOI still ends with `frame_done` and `ERR_TRUNC` |
| `out_fmt[1:0]` | in | `FMT_RGB` (0), `FMT_YCBCR` (1), `FMT_Y` (2); sampled when a frame starts |
| `px_valid`, `px_ready` | out/in | pixel handshake (AXI4-Stream style: a beat moves when both are high) |
| `px_x`, `px_y` | out | coordinates of the beat's first pixel |
| `px_n[2:0]` | out | pixels in the beat: always 1 for `FAST=0/1`; for `FAST=2` 4, fewer only where the beat reaches the right edge of the image |
| `px_c0`, `px_c1`, `px_c2` `[8*NPIX-1:0]` | out | R,G,B / Y,Cb,Cr / Y,128,128 (grey images in RGB: Y,Y,Y); pixel i of the beat (at `px_x + i`) in bits 8i+7..8i, `NPIX` = 1 (`FAST=0/1`) or 4 (`FAST=2`) |
| `px_sof`, `px_eol` | out | the beat starts the frame (0,0) / holds the last pixel of an image row (x = W-1) |
| `img_w`, `img_h`, `frame_start`, `frame_done` | out | frame size (valid from `frame_start`), end of frame |
| `err[12:0]` | out | errors of the current image (`rtl/jpeg_pkg.sv`): unsupported frame type, invalid/missing/incomplete tables or headers, corrupt data, truncated file, row buffer too small ... |

`FMT_YCBCR` hands out the upsampled Y, Cb, Cr without colour conversion; `FMT_Y` hands out luma
only, and chroma blocks are then only entropy-decoded (to keep the bitstream in step) but never
transformed, which makes decoding ~30 % faster. With `RASTER_OUT=1` pixels arrive in strict
raster order, so `px_sof`/`px_eol` map directly onto AXI4-Stream video `tuser`/`tlast`.

**Completion contract.** Every image that reaches its scan (SOS) produces exactly one
`frame_start` and one `frame_done`, also when it is unusable. Read `err` at `frame_done`: it
holds that image's errors (it is cleared when the next image's SOI is accepted; the input is held
at that SOI until the previous frame is done). If `err` is not zero, discard the frame's pixels.
An image with a header or table error produces no pixels at all. The parser only uses a table
that was read completely and legally, and only one that the image or an earlier one defined:
DQT (Pq = 0, Tq <= 3, no zero Qk), DHT (Tc/Th <= 1, a code tree that is not over-subscribed and
has no all-ones code, DC symbols <= 11), SOF0 (length, distinct Ci, Tq <= 3, non-zero width and
height - DNL is not supported), SOS (length, the frame's components in frame order as T.81 B.2.3
requires, defined tables), and RSTn in sequence. With `in_last` on the last byte, a truncated file
raises `ERR_TRUNC` and the decoder completes the frame from zero bits - its pixels are not meant to
be used (libjpeg fills the rest of such a scan with uniform grey instead, so they differ); a file
cut inside its headers gives a frame without pixels. With `in_last` tied to 0 a truncated file
leaves the decoder waiting for more bytes: reset it to abort. A file without any scan (tables
only, or no SOI) produces no frame.

### Parameters

| parameter | default | effect |
|---|---|---|
| `FAST` | 0 | 0: compact core (~13.6 clocks/pixel, smallest). 1: pipelined core, **~1-2.4 clocks/pixel** (Huffman lookahead tables, 2-lane pipelined IDCT, 1 pixel/clock output); same pixels, same interface. 2: wide core for larger FPGAs (Artix-7 class), **0.25-0.55 clocks/pixel** on phone photos (one Huffman symbol per clock, IDCT in 8 clocks per block, 4 pixels per beat), MCU order only (`RASTER_OUT=0`), same pixels |
| `NPIX` | derived | pixels per beat, 4 for `FAST=2` and 1 otherwise; set by `FAST` (other values stop the elaboration) |
| `RASTER_OUT` | 0 | 0: pixels in MCU order, 1 KB buffer, any width. 1: raster order via an MCU-row buffer |
| `ROWBUF_BYTES` | 16384 | row-buffer size for `RASTER_OUT=1`; images whose MCU row does not fit set `err[ERR_WIDTH]` and produce no pixels (the file is still consumed) |
| `FANCY_UPSAMPLE` | 0 | libjpeg-turbo's triangle-filter chroma upsampling (Pillow/OpenCV default) instead of replication; needs `RASTER_OUT=1` |
| `CC_TURBO` | 0 | YCbCr->RGB constants of libjpeg-turbo (`FIX(0.34414)`=22554) instead of libjpeg 9 (22553); differs for 59 of 65,536 (Cb,Cr) pairs |
| `RGB_OUT` | 1 | 0 removes the colour converter (~280 LEs) for YCbCr/luma consumers; `FMT_RGB` then delivers YCbCr |
| `CHECKS` | 1 | header and table validation (above); 0 saves ~100 LEs on a device where every LE counts |
| `ROWBUF_Y_BYTES`, `ROWBUF_C_BYTES` | 0 | `FAST=1` with `RASTER_OUT=1`: separate luma / chroma row buffers (0 = derived from `ROWBUF_BYTES`) |

Row-buffer bytes needed per 16 pixels of image width (`FMT_Y` stores luma only):

| sampling | replication | with `FANCY_UPSAMPLE` | `FMT_Y` |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| grey | 128 | 128 | 128 |
| 4:2:2 | 256 | 256 | 128 |
| 4:2:0 | 384 | 416 | 256 |
| 4:4:4 | 384 | 384 | 128 |
| 4:4:0 | 512 | 560 | 256 |

Tool notes: the RTL is the SystemVerilog-2005 subset that Quartus II 13.0sp1 accepts (the oldest
tool it targets), so newer tools take it unchanged. RAMs are written to infer block RAM
(`rtl/jpeg_sdp_ram.sv`); `(* ramstyle = "M4K" *)` and `(* multstyle = "dsp" *)` are Quartus hints
that other tools ignore.

### Resources

| device, tool | build | logic | memory | multipliers | Fmax |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Cyclone II EP2C5, Quartus 13.0sp1 | compact, MCU order (`boards/ep2c5/fpga`) | 3,374 LEs | 9 M4K | 26 9-bit | 61 MHz |
| Cyclone II EP2C5, Quartus 13.0sp1 | compact, raster + Pillow smoothing + RGB (`fpga_raster`) | 4,547 LEs | 25 M4K | 26 9-bit | 60 MHz |
| Cyclone II EP2C5, Quartus 13.0sp1 | fast, MCU order (`fpga_jtag`, board harness included) | 4,425 LEs | 59,712 bits | 26 9-bit | 98.7 MHz |
| Artix-7 XC7A200T-2, Vivado 2026.1 | fast, MCU order, decoder alone (from the build below) | 2,204 LUTs, 2,124 FFs | 13 BRAM18 | 17 DSP48E1 | - |
| Artix-7 XC7A200T-2, Vivado 2026.1 | fast, MCU order (`boards/acorn_cle215`, UART harness included) | 2,488 LUTs, 2,671 FFs | 7.5 BRAM36 | 17 DSP48E1 | 157-160 MHz |

The fast raster core (`FAST=1 RASTER_OUT=1`) needs ~6,900 LEs on a Cyclone IV E (EP4CE10).
More EP2C5 builds and their timing: `boards/ep2c5/README.md`.

## What is supported

Baseline sequential DCT (SOF0), 8-bit samples, Huffman coding, 1 or 3 components, sampling
factors 1 or 2 in each direction (4:4:4, 4:2:2, 4:4:0, 4:2:0, and luma-subsampled layouts), one
interleaved scan (components in frame order, T.81 B.2.3), restart intervals (DRI/RSTn), any
number of APPn/COM segments (EXIF thumbnails are skipped correctly), several tables per DQT/DHT
segment, image sizes up to 65535x65535 (MCU order; raster order up to the row-buffer width).
Not supported, flagged in `err`, and the scan is skipped to its EOI: progressive, lossless,
arithmetic coding, 12-bit samples, 16-bit quantisation tables, non-interleaved multi-scan files,
sampling factors 3/4, 4-component (CMYK) files. Adobe-RGB (no colour transform) files are decoded
as YCbCr. Dequantised coefficients and the IDCT workspace are 16-bit (saturating); real images
from 8-bit sources stay far inside that, so all test files match exactly.

## Verification

```sh
tb/run_tests.sh                       # SystemVerilog testbench: 1,818 + 90 + 468 runs (-s xsim for Vivado's simulator)
cd tb && make && make test            # the same runs with the C++ harness, driven by Python
python3 ../scripts/compare_refs.py corpus/*.jpg   # the model against Pillow / OpenCV / libjpeg-turbo
```
Both regressions compare against the reference images in `tb/golden/` (made by the Python model,
`model/jpeg_golden.py`); `tb/run_tests.sh` takes its expectations from `tb/expected.txt`,
`tb/stream_scenarios.txt` and `tb/malformed/cases.txt` (written by `tb/export_expectations.py`).

- **Test files** (`tb/corpus/`, 35 files): generated by `scripts/make_corpus.py` from one photo,
  `test_images/adapter.jpg` (settings of every file in `tb/corpus/SOURCES.md`): every chroma
  layout, sizes from 1x1 to 1160 px wide, restart intervals, an EXIF APP1 embedding a whole JPEG,
  strips at the row-buffer limits, dense q90-q98 images with Huffman codes up to 16 bits, and two
  unsupported files.
- **Reference model** (`model/jpeg_golden.py`): a bit-exact Python decoder in both profiles; on
  every corpus file it is identical to Pillow, OpenCV and libjpeg-turbo `djpeg` (default,
  `-nosmooth`, `-grayscale`) and to Pillow's YCbCr/luma draft modes (`scripts/compare_refs.py`).
- **RTL regression** (`tb/run_tests.py`): 9 build configurations (5 compact, 3 `FAST=1`, 1 `FAST=2`)
  x 3 output formats x 33 files x {no stalls, 30 % random input stalls + output back-pressure}, plus
  the 2 unsupported files = **1,818 runs, all bit-exact, with no unexpected error bit**, with
  strict raster order and `sof`/`eol` checked and `ERR_WIDTH` raised exactly where predicted.
- **Images back to back without reset** (`tb/run_stream_tests.py`): 90 runs.
- **Two independent testbenches**: the C++ harness (`make test`) and the SystemVerilog testbench
  (`tb/run_tests.sh`) run the same 2,376 checks and both pass all of them on Verilator; on Vivado's
  xsim the SystemVerilog testbench passes a 396-run subset of the compact and fast cores (MCU and
  raster output, smoothing, malformed files) and 264 runs of the wide and fast cores. xsim's stricter
  4-state semantics found problems that Verilator, Quartus and the hardware never showed: a loop
  counter shared by several `always` blocks, a signal used in a port connection before its
  declaration, and unreset valid bits in the wide core's IDCT pipeline (all fixed); and an xsim bug
  (`tab[idx[k]]` inside a procedural loop read as `tab[k]`) that the wide core's output stage now
  avoids.
- **Malformed and truncated files** (`tb/make_malformed.py`, `tb/run_malformed_tests.py`): 26
  files, each one edit away from a corpus file (bad, missing or incomplete DQT/DHT/SOF/SOS, RSTn
  errors, files cut in the headers, in the scan and before the EOI) x 9 configurations x 2 stall
  settings = **468 runs**: each must end with `frame_done`, the expected error bit and, for header
  errors, no pixels.
- **Colour converter**: exhaustive over all 2^24 (Y,Cb,Cr) inputs for both constant sets.
- **On hardware**: on the EP2C5 every test photo decodes with libjpeg's checksum and exactly the
  simulated clock count (`boards/ep2c5/fpga_jtag`); on the Artix-7 (fpgas.online) the owner's 12
  phone photos and 4:2:0 re-encodes of them decode identically to libjpeg 9e
  (`boards/acorn_cle215`).
- **Portability**: `sv2v` + Yosys synthesize the compact and the fast raster + smoothing
  configurations for Xilinx 7-series and Lattice ECP5 and the fast MCU-order core for Xilinx
  7-series without errors; Verilator lint is clean with implicit-net warnings enabled.

## History

BEBCL-JPEG grew out of Meraj Hasan's 2022 JPEG decoder in SystemVerilog, a simulation model written
from the ITU-T T.81 standard (marker parsing, quantisation and Huffman tables); those first
commits are kept in this repository's history (tag `original-2023`). The synthesizable decoder,
its tests and the board builds were developed from 2026 on; the full development history,
including the timing-closure work on the EP2C5, is on the `BEBCL-JPEG-development` branch.

  CLE-215+ (Artix-7 XC7A200T) board on which the three decoders were compared.
- The Independent JPEG Group (libjpeg) and the libjpeg-turbo project: the decoder's IDCT, colour
  conversion and upsampling arithmetic follow their code, and their decoders are the references.
- ultraembedded (core_jpeg) and Hidemi Ishihara (aq_djpeg), whose open-source decoders made the
  comparison possible; their code is not part of BEBCL-JPEG.
